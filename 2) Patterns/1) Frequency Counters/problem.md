write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. the function should return true if every value in the second array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. the frequency of values must be the same.

same([1,2,4], [4,1,9])  //true

same([1,2,3], [1,9])  //false

same([1,2,1], [4,4,1]) //false
